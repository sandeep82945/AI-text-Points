"covariance matrix and an adjacency matrix of a graph, i.e., positive semidefinite matrices whose eigenvectors and values have specific properties in terms of describing the heterogeneity in the data. in fact it can be argued the other way that graph fourier transforms and graph signal processing are the result of a “kernel trick” based on pca which is far older. so in this sense gnns/gcns are a more general class of networks that subsumes vnns.",this connection serves as a foundation for their proposed covariance neural network (vnn) architecture.,0.85666883,0.8035084,0.8292375,375

"the reward random variables collected in the high-fidelity and low-fidelity environments in the same state are correlated in a statistical sense (i.e., with a non-zero correlation coefficient). this is quite different from the usual idea of fidelity in multi-armed bandits (e.g., ""kandasamy, kirthevasan, gautam dasarathy, barnabas poczos, and jeff schneider. ""the multi-fidelity multi-armed bandit."" advances in neural information processing systems 29 (2016)."") in which the fidelity is represented as a bias on the expected reward (so, it is not a correlation in the statistical sense). consequently, in order for the approach to make sense, it must be that the reward is stochastic given the current state and action. it seems that the approach cannot be applied to rewards that are deterministic functions of the state-action pair. indeed, in such a case, there would be no correlation. requiring correlated reward random variables seems quite restrictive in my view. can the authors elaborate on this point?","the low- and high-fidelity state-action value functions are correlated, allowing the agent to effectively utilize low-fidelity data to improve its learning in the high-fidelity environment.",0.87789434,0.7983874,0.8362554,862
