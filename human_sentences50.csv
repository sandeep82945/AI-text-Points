ICR is just an indicator for the comparison between SGD and GD. There might be an approximation error due to the usage of HSGD and also the dimension, iteration time is finite. Hence, without this simulation, I am not convinced that SGD does outperform GD in terms of convergence speed.","However, note that the random feature model is a convex optimization problem, which differs a lot from realistic neural networks. Hence, small ICR on the random feature model cannot be used to show that SGD outperforms GD on realistic optimization problems, as the dynamics and challenges in non-convex settings are significantly different."
"value (for strongly convex cases, they converge exactly to the same point). To my best knowledge, all the previous papers studying the implicit regularization focus on nonconvex optimization.","For convex optimization, any algorithms, if convergent, then they should converge to the same function, which diminishes the significance of the claim regarding implicit regularization."
unfamiliar with it. It would be good if additional background information can be provided.,"who may not have a strong mathematical background, making it challenging to fully grasp the implications of the results presented."
