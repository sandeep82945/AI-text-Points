simpler transformer-based method MADT performs comparable to the proposed method.,"In environments like SMAC (where number of agents > 2), the centralized decision transformer may become a bottleneck."
errors in the text,These should be addressed to improve the overall readability of the paper.
"related works, the algorithms proposed in this paper achieve the best convergence rate with known condition number","The proposed methods effectively address the challenges posed by non-smooth outer functions, thus expanding the applicability of bilevel optimization."
but the previous works can not. It is good to mention more examples/applications of using non-smooth objectives.,"This may narrow the unique field of application of this work, i.e. this work can do more than just handle $L_1$ regularization, as the methods can be adapted to other non-smooth scenarios in various machine learning tasks."

improved. E.g. Perceiver IO was evaluated on 6 different modalities (Table 5 in their paper) and against non-general purpose baselines within each modality.,"To claim that NAC is a stronger general purpose architecture, the scope of the comparisons (now only few-shot adaptation and OOD generalization in CV datasets) and the number of baselines (now only Perceiver IO) both need to be reasonably expanded."

existing works even though the application scenario is new,"previously established concepts in the literature, lacking a groundbreaking innovation."
with initial hypothesis and then tests those hypothesis on CW10/CW20 benchmarks.,I like the fact that it uses pairs of tasks to come up with insightful observations about the transfer mechanisms.
still achieving state of the art performance in CW10/CW20,It effectively integrates the findings to enhance performance in continual reinforcement learning.
do appreciate the authors being very upfront about the limitations of the work.,"Hence, there’s a possibility that these findings are true only for the CW benchmarks, and further validation in diverse environments would strengthen the conclusions."

"$\epsilon = 5$. Also, it would be better if the performance is benchmarked on colored image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10).","The authors only chose $\epsilon = 1$ and 10, corresponding to high and low privacy budget."
model used for personalized treatment selection,the paper incorporates a novel aspect (treatment grouping) in a standard framework for estimating individualized treatment rules.
