values have specific properties in terms of describing the heterogeneity in the data.

For example, I'm assuming the environments they used in their experiments were implemented by the authors; at least the wording in line 291 seems to imply this is the case for the traffic control experiments, but nothing is said for the warehouse environment. More generally, I didn't see a lot of discussion of this point in the paper, which I would argue is an important omission.","This seems like not only a theoretical limitation, but also a strong practical one, as it means that environments that do not have a clear local structure may not benefit from this approach."

"tasks (detection, segmentation, human pose estimation), and additionally the authors consider a vision-and-language (V+L) task (i.e, image captioning). This introduces many concerns. It is unclear why the authors didn't include other popular V+L tasks such as image-text retrieval and visual question answering as they are commonly evaluated in the foundation model literature. Similarly, there are many popular pure vision tasks ignored in this paper, such as image/video recognition, NeRF, etc. Overall, this gives the impression that the task unification is achieved just because of a careful selection of downstream tasks in the experiments.",This ambiguity raises questions about the generalizability of their approach to other vision tasks that may not fit neatly into their defined categories.
"provided. Since image captioning has been well-studied in the unification literature in V+L field, the main new thing here is probably about unifying 3 selected pure vision tasks. However, pioneer works (such as MaskRCNN, HRNet, and others) already unify the three tasks very well. It is unclear what is the advantage of the proposed method (i.e., using the sequence modeling for the three tasks).","But no comparison with V+L foundation models is provided, which could offer insights into the relative strengths of their approach."

For example, the bottom-up approaches in human pose estimation literature can perform both multi-person pose estimation and instance segmentation at the same time with just a single forward-pass, but in this paper, the inference cost could grow linearly to the number of people. The inference interface is kind of restricted: (1) only a single task is supported at a time; (2) it predicts token-by-token slowly.","However, due to the nature of autoregressive prediction, the proposed model may face slower inference times compared to specialized systems."
"loss function, so that it is easier and scalable when performing large-scale pre-training. However, in this paper, the tasks considered require fine-grained annotations, and thus they do not have large-scale pre-training data (except for image captioning). For the considered downstream dataset, it is unclear if single-objective is more effective than multi-objective training.","In NLP and V+L research, people use a single model to achieve significant improvements, which raises questions about the scalability of this approach in vision tasks."

"the accuracy for one single train/validation split whereas the reference [10] shows a statistical mean of 82.2 +- 0.3% over 5 runs. For a fair comparison the authors should rerun the experiment and generate statistical mean/variance results for random train/validation split to remove any bias due to specific train/validation split selection. Additional details about the baseline model (ResNet-26) e.g., network architecture/training time/training accuracy would be helpful to get an all-round comparison.","However, the authors show limited discussion on the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the improved performance of their method."
the deep learning model for the specific problem being addressed. The paper lacks any detailed analysis on the contribution of the standardization and smoothening steps which could be generated by selectively applying these preprocessing steps.,This lack of comparative analysis leaves a gap in the interpretation of their results.
"paper. A discussion on these figures to help understand their results and how it compares to the baseline results would be helpful. For instance, the baseline has a higher antibiotic treatment classification accuracy than the proposed model, but this isn’t discussed and no justification is provided for the same.",Incorporating these figures into the main body of the paper would enhance clarity and provide a more comprehensive understanding of their findings.

"(when we use $L_1$ regularization). That may narrow the unique field of application of this work, i.e. this work can do but the previous works can not. It is good to mention more examples/applications of using non-smooth objectives.",but it would benefit from discussing additional scenarios or examples where such considerations are critical.

"purpose architecture, the scope of the comparisons (now only few-shot adaptation and OOD generalization in CV datasets) and the number of baselines (now only Perceiver IO) both need to be reasonably improved. E.g. Perceiver IO was evaluated on 6 different modalities (Table 5 in their paper) and against non-general purpose baselines within each modality.","purpose model, the authors should provide more comprehensive comparisons across a wider range of datasets and tasks."

I do appreciate the authors being very upfront about the limitations of the work.","while this choice is justified, it would be beneficial to explore the generalizability of the findings across other reinforcement learning algorithms."
to address is well motivated. The proposed approach seems new to me. Relevant literatures are well discussed.,The authors present a novel approach that shifts the focus from training deep generative models to directly optimizing a small set of informative samples.

"chose $\epsilon = 1$ and 10, corresponding to high and low privacy budget. Not sure whether what happens when the budget is moderate, say $\epsilon = 5$. Also, it would be better if the performance is benchmarked on colored image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10).",Further validation across a broader range of datasets and privacy settings would strengthen the claims and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

In addition, I believe that the framework the authors suggested might be used to analyze other optimization methods.",The theoretical framework presented is robust and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of gradient descent with chaotic perturbations.
"appendix and without justification or explanation. While I understand this is probably due to space constraints, this makes it hard to evaluate how general or reasonable the assumptions are and the limitations of the results.",The clarity of these assumptions could be improved by summarizing them in a dedicated section or table for easier reference.
"technically sound, although it is not clear how the specific choice of CKA influences the results, as it compares graph representations of original and coarsened graphs which have different dimensions (if my understanding is correct). The underlying motivations of the paper is clear and the proposed solution seems simple enough to be used in everyday research/industrial contexts. Perhaps it is not very clear what is the computational complexity of the regularization loss, and the authors may want to consider Section 4 after the experimental setup is introduced (see my first question below).",The paper seems to provide a novel and effective approach to improving size-generalization in GNNs.
"protocol which led to the creation of Table 3, the main empirical evaluation of the paper. From lines 219-234, it emerges that most hyper-parameters where chosen from [6], which is reasonable as long as the empirical setup stays the very same.",The experimental validation lacks robustness and thoroughness.

"the $\textbf{test}$ set. This would mean that the authors cherry-picked the results that maximize the performances on the test, rather than choosing them on the validation set. The authors are strongly encouraged to honestly and openly comment on this; it is possible that my evaluation is incorrect, but the combination of lines 275-277 with 224-225, together with the caption of Table 4, seems to point in this direction.",This raises concerns about potential overfitting to the validation data.
"coarsening ratio reflects the percentage of retained nodes, it may be helpful to explicitly write this in the paper.",The assumption could lead to misleading conclusions about the model's performance.
"results on PROTEINS, whereas it struggles on NCI1 for instance. It may have been a good idea to make an hyper-parameter study on the latter rather than the former dataset (but on the validation set)",This suggests that the proposed method should be compared against such baselines to validate its effectiveness.
